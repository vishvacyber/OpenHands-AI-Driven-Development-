"""
Admin endpoint for provisioning new users directly into an organization.

This is a privileged operation: it bypasses the normal sign-up flow
(email verification, TOS acceptance, OAuth IDP round-trip) and creates a
ready-to-use account on behalf of an org admin. Access is gated by the
``PROVISION_USER`` permission, which is granted to org-scoped ``owner``
and ``admin`` roles and explicit instance-level super roles (see
``server.auth.authorization``).

Flow (POST ``/api/organizations/provision-user``):

1. Resolve the target org from the ``X-Org-Id`` header (validated against
   the caller's memberships by ``require_permission``).
2. Create the user in Keycloak (realm configured by
   ``KEYCLOAK_REALM_NAME``), pre-verifying the email and setting a
   non-temporary password.
3. Request an offline refresh token for the new user via ROPC and store
   it via ``TokenManager.store_offline_token`` so the account can be used
   for backend operations (e.g. SDK calls) immediately.
4. Create the OpenHands user record (mirroring the ``keycloak_callback``
   shape), but with ``email_verified=True``, ``accepted_tos=now()``, and
   ``user_consents_to_analytics=True`` — no UI round-trips required.
5. Set up a LiteLLM integration for the user in the target org and add
   them with the requested role (``member`` by default, ``admin``, or ``owner``).
6. Mint an API key bound to the target org and return it to the caller.

The caller receives the email, password (generated if not supplied) and
API key in a single response. On failure after the Keycloak user is
created, ``_rollback_partial_provision`` compensates whatever subset of
steps already ran — see its docstring for the full unwind order.

**Compensation strategy.** Each post-Keycloak side effect is tracked by
a local progress variable so the unwind path can target exactly the
state that was created:

* ``openhands_user_id`` — set once ``UserStore.create_user`` returns,
  marking that the User row, personal Org, owner OrgMember row, default
  settings, and personal-org LiteLLM team all exist.
* ``target_membership_added`` — set once
  ``OrgMemberStore.add_user_to_org`` succeeds for the target org.

The order in the unwind matters: the personal-org cascade only
deletes the User row when the user is the sole orphan of the personal
org, so the target-org membership (if added) must be removed *before*
the cascade runs. See ``_rollback_partial_provision`` for the full
ordering and the rationale behind it.

**Known partial-cleanup gap (offline token).** Step 3a stores the
offline token before ``UserStore.create_user`` runs, mirroring the
production OAuth flow (``keycloak_offline_callback`` stores the
token before any ``UserStore`` interaction). The rollback path
removes the Keycloak user, which makes the orphaned offline token
row harmless — it is keyed by a Keycloak ``sub`` that no longer
exists, so it cannot be used to authenticate. The inverse ordering
(user-first) would leak the *entire* OpenHands cascade instead of a
single encrypted token blob, which is strictly worse. Periodic
``OfflineTokenStore`` reconciliation (if/when added) can sweep these.

**Known partial-cleanup gap (LiteLLM target-team membership).** When
``create_litellm_integration`` succeeded for the target org, the
provisioned Keycloak ``sub`` was added to the target org's LiteLLM
team and a per-user key was minted on the LiteLLM side. Removing the
OpenHands ``OrgMember`` row does not propagate to LiteLLM, so on
rollback the LiteLLM-side membership and key for that ``sub`` are
left behind. They are functionally inert (the Keycloak account is
deleted in the same unwind, so there is no way to authenticate as
the orphaned ``sub``), but they do accumulate. Cleanup should ride
on a future ``LiteLlmManager.remove_user_from_team(sub, org_id)``
helper rather than reaching into private internals from this route.

    """Best-effort rollback of a partially completed provision.

    Runs on the unwind path of an already-failed request. Every step is
    wrapped individually because we never want a secondary cleanup
    failure to mask the original provisioning error — the underlying
    helpers each log their own diagnostics, so swallowing here is
    intentional.

    Unwind order matters:

    1. **Target-org membership.** If ``OrgMemberStore.add_user_to_org``
       succeeded, the user has memberships in *both* the personal org
       and the target org. ``OrgStore.delete_org_cascade`` only
       cascade-deletes the ``User`` row when the user is the sole
       orphan of the org being deleted — a surviving target-org
       membership would cause the cascade to just reassign
       ``current_org_id`` to the target org and leave the user row
       behind. So we drop the target-org membership first.

       The freshly minted API key (step 6) is bound to ``target_org_id``
       and there is no failure step *after* the API key insert: if
       ``create_api_key`` raises mid-INSERT the row is never committed,
       and if it returns successfully the route never reaches this
       unwind. So the unwind does not need an explicit
       ``ApiKeyStore.delete`` call.

    2. **Personal-org cascade.** ``delete_org_cascade(personal_org_id,
       requester_user_id=kc_user_id)`` wipes the personal ``Org`` row,
       the owner ``OrgMember`` row, the personal-org LiteLLM team,
       org-scoped tables (``api_keys WHERE org_id =
       personal_org_id``, ``conversation_metadata_saas``,
       ``billing_sessions``, etc.) and — because the user is now sole
       orphan after step 1 — the ``User`` row itself, in a single
       transaction. ``requester_user_id`` must equal the deleted
       user's ``id`` so the cascade treats this as a personal-org
       self-service deletion rather than raising
       ``OrphanedUserError``.

    3. **Keycloak user.** Last, so the local OpenHands identity is
       gone before we drop the upstream identity. Re-doing the
       Keycloak delete via the existing ``delete_keycloak_user``
       helper keeps that retry/logging behaviour consistent with
       interactive-flow cleanup elsewhere.
